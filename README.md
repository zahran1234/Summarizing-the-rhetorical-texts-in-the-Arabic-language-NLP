# Advanced Rhetorical Analysis Algorithm

## Overview


Welcome to this unique repository where I have developed a cutting-edge algorithm for analyzing large texts using advanced rhetorical tools. This algorithm is designed to intelligently identify and extract sentences employing specific rhetorical devices – anaphora, analogy, and duplication – and then perform targeted summarization based on these stylistic elements.

## Project Overview

The core functionality of this algorithm lies in its ability to process extensive text documents and meticulously pinpoint sentences that utilize one or more of the following rhetorical techniques:

- **Anaphora**: Detection of sentences where a word or phrase is repeated at the beginning of successive clauses or sentences, creating a poetic effect.
- **Analogy**: Identification of sentences that draw parallels or make comparisons between two unrelated and dissimilar things, concepts, or ideas.
- **Duplication**: Recognition of duplicated words or phrases within the text, often used to emphasize a point or idea.

Once these sentences are isolated, the algorithm applies a sophisticated summarization technique, condensing the content while preserving the essence and impact of the rhetorical devices used.

## Features

- **Rhetorical Tool Extraction**: Leveraging NLP techniques to accurately identify sentences with specific rhetorical tools.
- **Intelligent Summarization**: Implementing advanced algorithms to summarize the text, focusing on the essence of the rhetorical elements.
- **User-Friendly Implementation**: A snippet included for easy application of the algorithm to various texts.
- **Broad Applicability**: Ideal for literary analysis, speech writing, and studying textual compositions in academia.

## How It Works

The algorithm processes the text in several stages:
1. **Text Parsing**: Breaking down the large text into individual sentences.
2. **Rhetorical Analysis**: Scanning each sentence for the presence of anaphora, analogy, and duplication.
3. **Extraction and Summarization**: Extracting relevant sentences and summarizing them based on the identified rhetorical devices.

## Usage

To use this algorithm:
1. Input your large text document into the system.
2. Run the algorithm to perform rhetorical analysis and summarization.
3. Obtain a concise and rhetorically enriched summary of the original text.

## Conclusion

This project stands at the intersection of computational linguistics and literary analysis, offering a powerful tool for understanding and summarizing texts through the lens of rhetorical techniques. It's a testament to how AI and NLP can enhance our appreciation and comprehension of complex literary devices.


### Rhetorical Tools
The project specifically looks for the following rhetorical tools in the text:
1. Analogy
2. Anaphora
3. Repetition

## Analogy
### Example
For a practical understanding, you can view an example of an analogy output at this [link](https://github.com/zahran1234/Summarizing-the-rhetorical-texts-in-the-Arabic-language-NLP/blob/main/analogy%20sample%20example.jpeg).

### Process
- **Detection**: The first step involves detecting if a sentence contains an analogy. This is achieved through the analysis of the sentence structure and content.
- **Elements Extraction**: Once an analogy is identified, the next step is to extract the elements that constitute the analogy. Typically, these elements are nouns.
- **Challenges Encountered**: Initial attempts using Large Language Models (LLMs) were faced with challenges related to data and performance. After data collection, the LLMs did not yield optimal results.

### Problems and Solutions
#### 1.1 Detecting Analogies in a Sentence
- **Approach**: The methodology involves categorizing analogies based on their specific cases.
- **Reference**: For detailed steps and methodologies, refer to the provided notebook.

#### 1.2 Extracting Elements of Analogy
- **Finding**: Research indicated that the elements forming an analogy are usually nouns.
- **Implementation Steps**: For a detailed guide on the extraction process, see the notebook.

## Additional Tools
### Anaphora and Repetition
While the main focus is on analogy, the project also includes methods to identify and summarize texts using anaphora and repetition. These rhetorical tools follow a similar detection and extraction process, tailored to their unique characteristics.

### Conclusion
This README offers a structured overview of the project aimed at summarizing Arabic texts based on rhetorical tools. For more detailed information, methodologies, and code examples, refer to the respective notebooks and resources in the repository.
