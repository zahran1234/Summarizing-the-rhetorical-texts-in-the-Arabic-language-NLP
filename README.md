# Summarizing-the-rhetorical-texts-in-the-Arabic-language-NLP

## Overview
This project focuses on extracting and summarizing sentences from large Arabic texts that utilize specific rhetorical tools. The goal is to identify sentences using these rhetorical elements and create summaries based on their usage. The implementation includes a snippet for performing this task.

### Rhetorical Tools
The project specifically looks for the following rhetorical tools in the text:
1. Analogy
2. Anaphora
3. Repetition

## Analogy
### Example
For a practical understanding, you can view an example of an analogy output at this [link](https://github.com/zahran1234/Summarizing-the-rhetorical-texts-in-the-Arabic-language-NLP/blob/main/analogy%20sample%20example.jpeg).

### Process
- **Detection**: The first step involves detecting if a sentence contains an analogy. This is achieved through the analysis of the sentence structure and content.
- **Elements Extraction**: Once an analogy is identified, the next step is to extract the elements that constitute the analogy. Typically, these elements are nouns.
- **Challenges Encountered**: Initial attempts using Large Language Models (LLMs) were faced with challenges related to data and performance. After data collection, the LLMs did not yield optimal results.

### Problems and Solutions
#### 1.1 Detecting Analogies in a Sentence
- **Approach**: The methodology involves categorizing analogies based on their specific cases.
- **Reference**: For detailed steps and methodologies, refer to the provided notebook.

#### 1.2 Extracting Elements of Analogy
- **Finding**: Research indicated that the elements forming an analogy are usually nouns.
- **Implementation Steps**: For a detailed guide on the extraction process, see the notebook.

## Additional Tools
### Anaphora and Repetition
While the main focus is on analogy, the project also includes methods to identify and summarize texts using anaphora and repetition. These rhetorical tools follow a similar detection and extraction process, tailored to their unique characteristics.

### Conclusion
This README offers a structured overview of the project aimed at summarizing Arabic texts based on rhetorical tools. For more detailed information, methodologies, and code examples, refer to the respective notebooks and resources in the repository.
