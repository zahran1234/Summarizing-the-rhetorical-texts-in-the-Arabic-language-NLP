First, i want to detect if the sentence has an analogy if yes I need to detect Elements of analogy 
In these two rows, we have a lot of details to depict everything 
First, we try to use  Large language models 
I had a problem with data and performance after collecting the data the LLMS didn't get the best results for me 

```
## we have 2 problems
### 1.1-How can i know if the sentence have analogy or not
```
we devide the cases of analogy into there case
check the notebook
